# Multer Tutorial

Simple file upload server created using react and expressjs. Also used [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.

This was a learning project that I found on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and wanted to experiment on using react.

## Demo

- Download the code
- Install the packages using npm install. This will create a `node_modules` folder
- build the react code using `npm run build`, which will create a build folder containing our bundled js and css
- start the backend server using `npm run serve`
- open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
